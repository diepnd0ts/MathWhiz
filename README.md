# MathWhiz
This is an Alexa skill application that generates and utters random math problems for users to answer. It first prompts the user for the level and the number of math problems and generates the quiz based on the user inputs. For each right or wrong answer the user makes, Alexa would make an exclamatory utterance such as "Booyah!" for a right answer and "Ruh Roh" for a wrong answer. I had a really fun time developing this application as I tried to make the Voice UI very engaging for the user.

This project was inspired by an Alexa Dev Day event that I attended in June 2017 in Los Angeles where I learned how to design a Voice User Interface with Alexa using AWS Lambda. I also learned how useful and effective serverless microservices like AWS Lambda is for developers in that it is very cheap and requires no server management at all.
